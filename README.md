# My Fedora Tiling Install

This script is to automate as much as possible the post installation of my Fedora system for a tiling window manager. Currently I am using Sway, but this might change. Obviously you take this repository and modify it to your taste.

1. Clone this repository to your home directory.

```bash
cd ~
git clone git@github.com:sgt7xyz/my-fedora-tiling-sgt7.git
cd Fedora-tiling-sgt7
```

2. Run the fedoraTilingSetup.sh script

```bash
$ chmod 700 fedoraTilingSetup.sh
$ ./fedoraTilingSetup.sh
```
